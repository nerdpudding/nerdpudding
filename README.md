### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying software development. I just started learning OOP with C# and have some basic knowledge of C and Python as well, but still have a lot to learn. I have worked with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code so far and am now exploring more about GitHub, which led me to create this profile. There isnâ€™t much in here yet, but that might change!
